This
place ehh
hh
the
lighting
WRECKS
MY
WHOLE
EXISTENCE
But
I
never
leave
without
purchasing
something
householdish
is
that
a
word
I
gotta
give
it
to
them
they
have
some
nice
steals
you
can
randomly
purchase
However
they
rarely
ever
have
anything
specific
The
line
is
always
long
so
make
sure
your
purchase
is
worth
while
and
equally
that
you
will
not
want
to
return
it
because
you
will
have
to
stand
in
that
long
line
again
On
average
I
will
go
back
on
a
random
free
day
if
I
happen
to
go
to
TJ Max
next
door
again
where
I
found
nothing
by
the
way
